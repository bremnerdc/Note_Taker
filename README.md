# Express Note Taker

## Description

This note taker is created using express.js. The user can compile a list of notes, whether it be books to read, groceries, or things to do. The user can create, save, and delete each note.

In the future, I would like to provide the user the option to edit their notes as well.

Building this program has taught me much more about shifting into back end web development, taking one step closer to full-stack web development.
